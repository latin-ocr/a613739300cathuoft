,ΗεαΖιΙι and benediction in our lord Christ Jes‘uS.

A few months ag0‚ we separately solicited your prayerS‚ *
and we enjoined public supplicationS‚ to obtain for our-
selves the light and guidance of God's Holy spirit, in ¹the
§ynod which had been convoked‚ and appointed to he held
by uS, on the sixth of July‚ at St. Mary's College. lt is
now our more pleasingduty, conjointly to address you, be-
fore separating3 to announce to you, that Almighty God
has graciously heard your prayerS‚ and to claim from you
a tribute of sincere and cordia! thanksgiving to Him, for
His many mercies bestowed upon us, For, although it
would ill become us to speak with commendation os any-
thing that we have done, and according to our divine Mas-
ter's commandS‚ we must needs say, at the conclusion of
our work, that ἰ we are only unprofitable servants (1), »
