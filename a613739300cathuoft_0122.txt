In effecting these most usesul purposeS‚ and procuring
means for encouraging a high order of education‚ as well
as extensively diffusing its blessingS‚ we consider that the
institution established by uS‚ and known as the Poor
School Commium, has been eminently useful‚ and deserves
our public approbation‚ and our joint recommendation.
Composed as it is of priests and laymen, selected from
all our DioceseS‚ it has attended to their several interests
with fidelity and impartiality ; and it has been the instru-

which, without its ‹zo-operation, would not have reached
uS. Through it, the character of our poor school teaching
has been signally raised3 and the erectiori os normal and
training schOOIS‚ which we now owe to its exertions and
zeal, promises to secure, on a stable basis , the future en-
joyment of this blessing. We, therefore, exhort and urge
you to support this excellent Institution, by your liberal
contributions , by your hearty co-operation ‚ and by your
friendly encouragement.

cannot, of course, conceal from ourselveS‚ that the encou-
ragement which the state, or the policy of the age, gives
to education‚ has a tendency to increase the importance
of worldly knowledge, if not to the disparagement‚ at least
to the consequent depreciation‚ of religious learning. The
inspection‚ the rewardS‚ the honourS‚ derived from the
state, are strictly limited to proficiency in the former class
