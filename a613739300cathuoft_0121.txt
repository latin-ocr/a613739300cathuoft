solves lovingly, this burthen ‚ 01· providing‚ if possible per-
manent] y, for 1110 education of your destitute neighbourS.
Do not rest until you sec this want supplied : prefer the
051011115111110111 of good schools to every other work. lndec‘d',
whercver there may 500111 10 bc an opening for a new mis-

leave an excuse to lukewarmnessMake your schools equal
in every respect to those which are opencd to 0111110 away
our children. Avail yourselves 01· every encouragement‚
and every improvement, which tends to raise the standard
